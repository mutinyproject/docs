== Name

software - list of recommended software for use with Mutiny

== System
* https://sr.ht/~mcf/libtls-bearssl[libtls-bearssl] is an implementation of libtls using
  https://bearssl.org[BearSSL], one of the most promising SSL libraries in recent times.
* https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai[samurai] is an alternative implementation of `ninja`,
  which will be used instead of `ninja` in Mutiny.
* https://git.sr.ht/~mcf/cproc[cproc] is a C compiler using https://c9x.me/compile/[QBE] as the
  backend; it could be really compelling to base Mutiny around once it can build the kernel.
* https://mkws.sh/pp.html[pp] is a pretty cool pre-processor for files.

== Networking
* https://github.com/troglobit/mdnsd[mdnsd] - multicast daemon for announcing services
* https://github.com/ddevault/aerc[aerc] - terminal mail client that doesn't suck to setup anywhere
  near as much as mutt
* https://git.causal.agency/pounce[pounce] - TLS-only IRC bouncer with great multi-client
  functionality, pairs well with...
* https://git.causal.agency/catgirl[catgirl] - TLS-only IRC client with a good set of features
  and great IRCv3 support
* https://git.causal.agency/litterbox[litterbox] - TLS-only IRC logger that utilizes sqlite, allows
  for expressive search syntax via `/query`ing yourself
* Web browsing
    ** https://www.qutebrowser.org[qutebrowser] - Qt5 and WebKit based browser. keyboard driven,
       takes some getting used to but definitely looks like one of the most promising minimalistic
       browser projects out there

== Desktop
* https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm] - tiling window manager using binary space
  partitioning, controlled via a socket-based command line program
* https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd] - Xorg hotkey daemon with a powerful configuration
  syntax, mouse chording, works very well with bspwm
* https://github.com/TomaszGasior/gtk3-mushrooms[gtk3-mushrooms] - patches for gtk3 that make it
  nicer for non GNOME desktops. no CSD, client side shadows, and so on. though, maybe it'd be nicer
  to just avoid gtk3, if we can't do it without dbus... or just to prefer Qt5.
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpid2[acpid] - not as extensive as i'd like; something like a
  real power manager that has the ability to react per-user to power events would be more
  compelling. unless maybe acpid can be scripted to act that way?
* https://github.com/troglobit/xplugd[xplugd]
* https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock[xss-lock]
* https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes[unclutter-xfixes]
* https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi[rofi] - pretty bloated, but a great deal more useful than
  dmenu.
* https://github.com/maandree/adjbacklight[adjbacklight]
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst]
* https://github.com/google/xsecurelock[xsecurelock]

== Misc
* https://www.passwordstore.org/[password-store] - something without a dependency on bash would be
  nicer though; there *are* some reimplementations/workalikes like https://github.com/nmeum/tpm[tpm]
  and https://notabug.org/kl3/spm[spm] are regular sh, but they lack a lot of features and
  niceities.
    ** https://github.com/dylanaraps/pash[pash] - appears to be more in line with what I want.
       configuration seems kinda odd, though.
