# riot-design(7)
## Design of the `riot` package manager.

## Wishlist

- Multiple repositories
    - intra-repository dependencies
    - importance levels
        - `::mutiny` is the most important repository
        - other repositories can always depend on libraries in repositories that are more important
- Repository synchronization
    - we might not want to have `git` in the basic system requirements
    - we could offer synchronization via tar archives *or* git repositories; gitlab has autogenerated archives
    - multiple ways to sync repositories
        - paludis has sync prefixes: `cave sync -s local repository`

## Configuration

## `/etc/riot/masks`

```text
ignore      linux-headers[>$(uname -r | cut -d- -f1)]
```

## `/etc/riot/build.conf`

```text
*           -* ruby ssl
toybox      MAKEFLAGS="-j1" static
lighttpd    -ssl webdav pcre MAKEFLAGS="-j -l3"
```

## `/etc/riot/world`

Packages specifically requested to be installed by the user. They were not installed
as dependencies of other packages.

```
beets
lighttpd
mpd
pass
```
