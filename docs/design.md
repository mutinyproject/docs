# Design of system
## Details, overview, and other notes about the design of a theoretical Mutiny system.

Mutiny is a project inspired by multiple different Linux distributions, software made in
response to system hegemony, embedded systems, interest in BSD-styles of design, and an
interest in forward-thinking system design.

Systems should carry as little legacy, and give as little bend to the popular software
and development groups as possible. Open standards exist for this very reason, to give
us the ablity to create diversity in the computer world while preserving the ability to
maintain a level of operability with systems of other origin, ideology, and reasoning.

Additionally, this ideal system should aim for using the best solution, with the best
developers, and the people most partaking in this line of thinking, over any alternative.
No developing for proprietary unixes anymore, no more RedHat, no more GNU, no more groups
with all the power; decentralize.

Software should be chosen that is in line with the idea of a slim, opinionated (but not
difficult to use if you don't entirely agree with the choices made) operating system.

Recommended readings along this thinking are any policy by the OpenBSD group,
talks by Rob Landley, ...

Aim to support any use case worth supporting: desktop, server, small devices, containers

## System

### Software base

- Avoid GNU software when a viable alternative exists
    - Best example: gcc vs clang
- Prefer software with less legacy
- Slim software whenever it is possible.
- Package base
    - `musl`
    - `clang`
    - `libc++`
    - `fortify-headers`
    - `libressl`
    - `mandoc`
    - `toybox`
    - `busybox`
    - `mksh`... or maybe `pdksh`/`loksh`

## Filesystem layout

```text
/   - Also the root user's home directory.
    /boot               - Boot files
    /dev                - Device files (devtmpfs)
    /etc                - Configuration
    /home               - User files
    /host -> ${CHOST}   - Symlink to default CHOST
    /local              - System-specific files (not managed by packages)
        /local/share    - User-managed resources. (separate, not arch-specific)
    /mnt            - Mounted devices
    /proc           - Process/system information (procfs)
    /run            - Runtime files (non-persistent), such as... (tmpfs)
        /run/tmp        - Temporary files
    /share          - Documentation, other resources
    /src            - Source (kernel things, usually)
    /srv            - Service data (httpd, git-daemon)
    /sys            - System/kernel information (sysfs)
    /var            - Variable files (persistent), such as...
        /var/cache      - Caches
        /var/log        - Logs
        /var/lib        - State files maintained by programs
        /var/spool      - Spools maintained by programs (crond, cups, etc)
        /var/tmp        - Temporary files not cleared at boot
    /${CHOST}   - Directories containing ${CHOST}-only files (bins/libs)
        /bin            - Binaries
        /include        - Header files for libraries
        /lib            - Libraries, internal binaries for other programs
        /local/bin      - User-managed binaries
        /local/include  - User-managed header files
        /local/lib      - User-managed libraries, internal binaries
```

There's also some symlinks so we don't have to wrestle with other software...

```text
/
    /bin            -> host/bin
    /lib            -> host/lib
    /lib64          -> host/lib64               - Only on x86_64 hosts
    /local/bin      -> ../host/local/bin
    /local/include  -> ../host/local/include
    /local/lib      -> ../host/local/lib
    /local/sbin     -> ../host/local/sbin
    /media          -> mnt
    /sbin           -> host/sbin
    /tmp            -> run/tmp
    /usr            -> .
    /var/run        -> ../run
```

## Package design

- Reasonable command line interface
- Run (inexpensive) tests by default
- Libraries
    - See: Gentoo's eclasses, Exherbo's exlibs.
- Useful metadata
    - Build dependencies vs. runtime dependencies
    - Licenses
    - Links to documentation

## Prior art

- OpenBSD
- Sabotage Linux
- Void Linux
- Stali
- Morpheus Linux
- Exherbo Linux

## Mutiny utilities

- `riot` - source-based and binary-based package manager
- `synonym` - utility for managing alternatives
