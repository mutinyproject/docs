= praxis-design(7)

Design of the `praxis` package manager.

== Wishlist

* multiple repositories
    ** intra-repository dependencies
    ** importance levels
        *** `::pkg` is the most important repository
        *** other repositories can always depend on libraries in repositories that are more important
* repository synchronization
    ** we might not want to have `git` in the basic system requirements
        *** sounds like a great way to justify having `rsync` be a sysreq though... which is also
            kinda bad. that said, there is stuff like `openrsync` now...
        *** having full history of the source repositories on your system is very appealing though
            and would be very much in line with system principles
    ** we could offer synchronization via tar archives _or_ git repositories; gitlab and github
       both can do autogenerated archives for each commit, the `master` branch, etc.
    ** multiple ways to sync repositories
    ** Paludis has sync prefixes: `cave sync -s local repository`, which is really useful for
    development of repositories
* something akin to `apt-get source` would be pretty nice
*
