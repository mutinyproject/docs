== Name

mutiny - BSD-inspired Linux system and research project aiming to be a testbed for interesting
system design, forward thinking design choices, minimalism, and fun computing

== Synopsis

Mutiny is a project aiming to deliver a Linux distribution that prioritizes a consistent,
interesting, and fun to use system. Influenced heavily by BSD system design, minimalist software,
and an interest in forward-thinking system design, Mutiny aims to explore alternatives to the
hegemony that makes up most Linux distributions.

Mutiny is young! If you find the ideas here interesting, please reach out at
irc://irc.freenode.net/#mutiny.

There's a set of https://git.mutiny.red/mutiny[git repositories]. No bootable system yet, this OS
mostly exists as a pile of documents and some broken chroots for now.

This is the main document, here's a few other documents written currently:

* A design document about <<praxis.7.adoc#,praxis>>, the package manager.
* A longer but unfinished document about the package API, <<theory.5.adoc#,theory>>.
* A <<software.7.adoc#,running list of software>> that might be of interest for Mutiny.

== Goals

*Consistency*::
    Linux systems have suffered from a large amount of inconsistencies in maintenance and style.
    This is part due to the bazaar model of development, but it doesn't have to be this way.
    Software should be bent to conform, and users should come to expect things are going to be a
    certain way on a *Mutiny* system.

*Uniqueness*::
    There are advantages that come with many sorts of distributions acting all alike. But, if you
    aren't a fan of the similarities, it means there's not much of an alternative for you to look
    out for. We don't all want a Windows, or a GNOME, or a Mac, and that's okay, just like the
    people that do. Keeping in line with the testbed attitude, *Mutiny* will always try to make a
    unique system that people can learn to appreciate for the differences.

*Alternatives*::
    In the Linux world there is often an acceptance that some of the system just
    sucks, but that's just what we're stuck with. And that's reasonable in some cases where
    alternatives don't exist.
    However, *Mutiny* should aim to thoroughly explore alternatives when they do exist.

*Documentation*::
    The system should be thoroughly documented so that you never need to
    reference external websites in order to learn about it. Documentation should be consistent,
    too. On *Mutiny*, all documentation should be accessible through *man* or _/share/doc_.

=== Documentation

The state of system administration nowadays can be very fragmented. Most people just search for the
documentation online nowadays, finding the manuals to be lacking, or just too archaic.

However this is rarely a problem with *BSD systems. This is because BSD systems, historically, have
put more emphasis on good documentation of their systems. Every single aspect of the kernel's
internals, drivers, quirks, etc., is documented in a manpage.

On a large scale, this unity in the system is what Mutiny is striving for. Linux systems have had a
tendency to be disjointed at times, as the model which the system is developed in doesn't usually
correspond to the stewardship that comes with the tightly-managed attitude of something like
OpenBSD.

Manual pages will be required for any package that installs a program to _/bin_, and in all files in
_/etc_ will also require manual pages to exist for them.

=== Standards adherence

:filesystem-hierarchy-standard:     http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html
:file-hierarchy:                    https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/file-hierarchy.html
:xdg-base-directory-specification:  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

Mutiny should aim to adhere to standards whenever it is possible, and enforce those standards
on all software that the system uses. When a standard isn't good, or we think it is badly
designed, we should aim to supersede it with a defined standard of our own. The prime example
of a bad standard being replaced in Mutiny is the <<Filesystem layout>>, which supersedes the
{filesystem-hierarchy-standard}[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard] and systemd's
{file-hierarchy}[file-hierarchy].

Good examples of standards we want to follow would be standards like the
{xdg-base-directory-specification}[XDG Base Directory Specification].

Nonessential but otherwise interesting software that would be a good fit to the philosophy can be
found on the <<software.adoc#,software page>>.

=== Filesystem layout

In the Mutiny layout, there are a few goals:

* Accomodate some common paths; `#!/bin/sh`, etc.
* Embrace the _good_ innovations that have occurred, like `/run` and the `/sbin`+`/bin` merge.
* Remove redundancy. No more `/media` or `/usr`, `/tmp` points to `/run/tmp`.

```

At one point, there was an intent to support cross-compilation, akin to Exherbo's multiarch design.
This has been removed due to a lack of necessity and ultimately, little gain for a lot of pain to
take on.

== Package design

* Reasonable command line interface
* Run (inexpensive) tests by default
* Libraries
    ** See: Gentoo's eclasses, Exherbo's exlibs
* Useful metadata
    ** Build dependencies vs. runtime dependencies
    ** Licenses
    ** Links to documentation

== Notes

(ideally these will disappear and turn into their own sections or pages or what have you)

=== On languages and internationalization

The insistance of English being "the default language of computing" as a rationale to justify
not replacing `gettext` is rather stupid, when not a bit xenophobic. Asserting default languages
of entire fields has real world implications when it gets down to the people using them. There's a
really interesting tendency in the Unix development crowds that have minimalist design tendencies
to just ignore this.

Mutiny packages should allow for options to only install whatever languages are going to be used.
We _can_ set `en_US` as the default language that is enabled in packages, but only if we are going
to provide complete support to those who speak other languages. There's an obvious question here
as to documentation and support through things like IRC though, and I'm only one person.

=== Documentation

A goal should be to ensure that most documentation is `mdoc` format. `s6` is a notable example of a
project that doesn't currently have manpages, though I believe that's something many people in the
community have been wanting.

There's a few tools written by the main `mandoc` dev that convert other formats to mdoc, they might
be worth looking at.

* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/docbook2mdoc[`docbook2mdoc`]
* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/pod2mdoc[`pod2mdoc`]
* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/texi2mdoc[`texi2mdoc`]

=== s6 based stuff

In Mutiny, a goal should be to have the same software powering many scopes of the system. This
promotes the ability to have an intimate familiarity with the foundation of your system, and thus an
easier introduction to administrating it and doing cool stuff with it. A really good point in which
this can be carried out is in `s6` and `s6-rc`.

I have a work in progress implementation of doing this at the `xinit` level, since it's definitely
possible to do a supervisor as your session manager for Xorg sessions. Furthermore, this should be
able to be carried up to the login level. (call it `commune-user`) This could mean user services
for users on the system, akin to systemd's user scope...

=== Software contortions

* XDG contortions
    ** https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory#Partial[lots of software can be told to use XDG if you just give them the right variables]
    ** should software distributed by us be patched to use XDG?
