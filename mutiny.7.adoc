== Name

mutiny - BSD-inspired Linux system and research project aiming to be a testbed for interesting
system design, forward thinking design choices, minimalism, and fun computing

== Synopsis

Mutiny is a project aiming to deliver a Linux distribution that prioritizes a consistent,
interesting, and fun to use system. Influenced heavily by BSD system design, minimalist software,
and an interest in forward-thinking system design, Mutiny aims to explore alternatives to the
hegemony that makes up most Linux distributions.

Mutiny is young! If you find the ideas here interesting, please reach out at
irc://irc.freenode.net/#mutiny.

There's a set of https://git.mutiny.red/mutiny[git repositories]. No bootable system yet, this OS
mostly exists as a pile of documents and some broken chroots for now.

This is the main document, here's a few other documents written currently:

* A design document about <<praxis.7.adoc#,praxis>>, the package manager.
* A longer but unfinished document about the package API, <<theory.5.adoc#,theory>>.
* A <<software.7.adoc#,running list of software>> that might be of interest for Mutiny.

== Goals

[#goal-grokkability]
*Grokkability*::
    (grok: verb. "to understand profoundly and intuitively") +
    Do you think you could ever come to understand what you run on your computer day in and day out?
    There's something to be said for being able to. While some things in a system can usually be
    overlooked, on *Mutiny* we want to promote an understandable, conceptualizable system.
    You don't _have_ to understand what everything does as an end--but it should be encouraged to
    learn how the pieces fit together, to learn the philosophy, and really become infatuated with
    some of the unique ideas being brought forth.

[#goal-consistency]
*Consistency*::
    Linux systems have suffered from a large amount of inconsistencies in maintenance and style.
    This is part due to the bazaar model of development, but it doesn't have to be this way.
    Software should be bent to conform, and users should come to expect things are going to be a
    certain way on a *Mutiny* system.

[#goal-uniqueness]
*Uniqueness*::
    There are advantages that come with many sorts of systems acting all alike. But, if you aren't a
    fan of the similarities, it means there's not much of an alternative for you to look out for.
    We don't all want Windows, or GNOME, or a Mac, and that's okay, just like the people that do.
    Keeping in line with the testbed attitude, *Mutiny* will always try to make a unique system that
    people can learn to appreciate for the differences.

[#goal-alternatives]
*Alternatives*::
    In the Linux world there is often an acceptance that some of the system just sucks,
    but that's just what we're stuck with.
    And that's reasonable in some cases where alternatives don't exist.
    However, *Mutiny* should aim to thoroughly explore alternatives when they do exist.

[#goal-documentation]
*Documentation*::
    The system should be thoroughly documented so that you never need to
    reference external websites in order to learn about it. Documentation should be consistent,
    too. On *Mutiny*, all documentation should be accessible through *man* or _/share/doc_. +
    Manual pages will be required for any package that installs a program to _/bin_, and in all
    files in _/etc_ will also require manual pages to exist for them.

[#software-avoid]
.Software being avoided
Most GNU software::
    It's a bit played out. I'd just like to see what more there is out there.

https://gnupg.org[GnuPG]::
    {url-pgp}[PGP kinda really sucks and we all need to give up the ghost.]
    And it has a bunch of dependencies, and it's horrendously bloated in terms of features.

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus[dbus]::
    I'm interested in seeking out alternatives to it for a few reasons.

    . There's only two real implementations of it: the reference implementation, which is what most
      people use and apparently has enough performances issues that people are working to shove it
      into the kernel instead of userspace, and https://github.com/bus1/dbus-broker[dbus-broker],
      which seems to have some level of dependency on systemd. While it might not necessarily be the
      case, this to me signifies some level of complexity in implementation that I'm not interested
      in accepting as the norm, and possibly as a system component if enough things want to use it.
    . There seems to be some good criticism to be had that it is reinventing the wheel.
    . I think that some of its features, such as service activation, have no place in a system bus.

    . All this aside: it's still required if you use Bluetooth on Linux.

    . Alternative: {skarnet}/skabus[skabus]. Heavily a work in progress, but it looks interesting.
      For now though, the plan is just to stay away from dbus as much as possible.

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio[PulseAudio]::
    . A bit worryingly complex.
    . The main appeal of it is in multiplexing sound sources on one sound card. This can already be
      done with ALSA, it's just not pretty to configure.
    . The alternative: http://www.sndio.org[sndio]. It's from OpenBSD, it seems to be a lot simpler,
      and fits in well with the philosophy we're going for because of this.

Nonessential but otherwise interesting software that would be a good fit to the philosophy can be
found on the <<software.7.adoc#,software page>>.

=== Filesystem layout

In the Mutiny layout, there are a few goals:

* Accomodate some common paths; `#!/bin/sh`, etc.
* Embrace the _good_ innovations that have occurred, like `/run` and the `/sbin`+`/bin` merge.
* Remove redundancy. No more `/media` or `/usr`, `/tmp` points to `/run/tmp`.

See <<hier.7.adoc#,hier(7)>> for a full explanation of the layout.

== Prior art

* https://www.exherbo.org[Exherbo Linux] - My former distribution of choice, helped me realize the
  potential of source-based distributions; ultimately our interests diverged.
* https://www.openbsd.org[OpenBSD]
* http://sabotage.tech[Sabotage Linux]
* https://alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux]
* https://voidlinux.org[Void Linux]
* https://github.com/michaelforney/oasis[oasis]
* https://github.com/kissx/kiss[kiss linux]

== Notes

(ideally these will disappear and turn into their own sections or pages or what have you)

=== On languages and internationalization

The insistance of English being "the default language of computing" as a rationale to justify
not replacing `gettext` is rather stupid, when not a bit xenophobic. Asserting default languages
of entire fields has real world implications when it gets down to the people using them. There's a
really interesting tendency in the Unix development crowds that have minimalist design tendencies
to just ignore this.

Mutiny packages should allow for options to only install whatever languages are going to be used.
We _can_ set `en_US` as the default language that is enabled in packages, but only if we are going
to provide complete support to those who speak other languages. There's an obvious question here
as to documentation and support through things like IRC though, and I'm only one person.

=== Documentation

A goal should be to ensure that most documentation is `mdoc` format. `s6` is a notable example of a
project that doesn't currently have manpages, though I believe that's something many people in the
community have been wanting, and in fact something I plan to contribute upstream.

There's a few tools written by the main `mandoc` dev that convert other formats to mdoc, they might
be worth looking at.

* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/docbook2mdoc[`docbook2mdoc`]
* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/pod2mdoc[`pod2mdoc`]
* https://mandoc.bsd.lv/texi2mdoc[`texi2mdoc`]

=== s6 based stuff

In Mutiny, a goal should be to have the same software powering many scopes of the system. This
promotes the ability to have an intimate familiarity with the foundation of your system, and thus an
easier introduction to administrating it and doing cool stuff with it. A really good point in which
this can be carried out is in `s6` and `s6-rc`.

I have a work in progress implementation of doing this at the `xinit` level, since it's definitely
possible to do a supervisor as your session manager for Xorg sessions. Furthermore, this should be
able to be carried up to the login level. (call it `commune-user`) This could mean user services
for users on the system, akin to systemd's user scope...

=== Open questions

:url-archxdg: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory

https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/[XDG standards]::
    In line with the consistency goal, we should really closely follow organizational standards
    like the XDG Base directory specification. (which is the origin of things like ~/.config,
    ~/.local, ~/.cache, and so on) +
    . TODO: Should software distributed by Mutiny be _patched_ to use XDG?
