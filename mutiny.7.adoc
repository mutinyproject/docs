== Name

mutiny - a Linux distribution that aims to be a testbed for interesting system design, forward
thinking choices, and fun computing

== Synopsis

Mutiny is a project inspired by multiple different Linux distributions, software made in response to
system hegemony, embedded systems, interest in BSD-styles of design, and an interest in
forward-thinking system design. Systems can be integrated, be well put together, and allow for
deviance.

Systems should carry as little legacy, and give as little bend to the popular software and
development groups as possible. Open standards exist for this very reason, to give us the ability to
create diversity in the computer world while preserving the ability to maintain a level of
interoperability with systems of other origin, ideology, and reason.

Decentralize. Using software from one development group means you become beholden to the interests
of that group, and it promotes vendor lock-in; the clearest example of this would be how much the
state of the Unix desktop and server has changed because of the choices that GNOME, RedHat, etc.
have made.

We live in a time where systems are changing rapidly, and the possibilities of system design are
changing in new exciting ways. Mutiny is a response to this, an attempt to carry out the perfect
concept of a modern Unix system with attention paid at every level.

Aim to support any use case worth supporting: desktop, server, small devices, containers.

== Philosophy

This section will outline the intent and approach to design that Mutiny aims to have.

=== Core concepts

* **Consistency**: Unix systems have suffered from a large amount of inconsistencies
  in maintenance and style in the past decades. Software should be bent to conform, and
  users should come to expect things are going to be a certain way on a Mutiny system.
* **Documentation**: The system should be thoroughly documented so that you never need to
  reference external websites in order to learn about it. Documentation should be consistent,
  too. This means all documentation should be accessible through `man` or `/usr/share/doc`.
* **Security**: Mutiny should strive for secure design. We should be proactive and use hardening
  measures when possible, through `FORTIFY_SOURCE`, kernel hardening, and other measures.

=== Standards adherence

:filesystem-hierarchy-standard:     http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html
:file-hierarchy:                    https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/file-hierarchy.html
:xdg-base-directory-specification:  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

Mutiny should aim to adhere to standards whenever it is possible, and enforce those standards
on all software that the system uses. When a standard isn't good, or we think it is badly
designed, we should aim to supersede it with a defined standard of our own. The prime example
of a bad standard being replaced in Mutiny is the <<filesystem layout>>, which supersedes the
{filesystem-hierarchy-standard}[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard] and systemd's
{file-hierarchy}[file-hierarchy].

Good examples of standards we want to follow would be standards like the
{xdg-base-directory-specification}[XDG Base Directory Specification].

=== System administration

The state of system administration nowadays can be very fragmented. Most people just search for the
documentation online nowadays, finding the manuals to be lacking, or just too archaic.

However, you will notice this is rarely a problem with *BSD systems. This is because BSD systems,
historically, have put more emphasis on good documentation of their systems. Every single aspect of
the kernel's internals, drivers, quirks, etc., is documented in a manpage.

On a large scale, this unity in the system is what Mutiny is striving for. Linux systems have had a
tendency to be disjointed at times, as the model which the system is developed in doesn't usually
correspond to the stewardship that comes with the tightly-managed attitude of something like OpenBSD.

Where we can best improve this is in the administration of a system.

== Package design

* Reasonable command line interface
* Run (inexpensive) tests by default
* Libraries
    ** See: Gentoo's eclasses, Exherbo's exlibs
* Useful metadata
    ** Build dependencies vs. runtime dependencies
    ** Licenses
    ** Links to documentation

== Random notes

(ideally these will disappear and turn into their own sections or pages or what have you)

=== On languages and internationalization

The insistance of English being "the default language of computing" as a rationale to justify
not replacing `gettext` is rather stupid, when not a bit xenophobic. Asserting default languages
of entire fields has real world implications when it gets down to the people using them. There's a
really interesting tendency in the Unix development crowds that have minimalist design tendencies
to just ignore this.

Mutiny packages should allow for options to only install whatever languages are going to be used.
We _can_ set `en_US` as the default language that is enabled in packages, but only if we are going
to provide complete support to those who speak other languages. There's an obvious question here
as to documentation and support through things like IRC though, and I'm only one person.

=== Documentation

A goal should be to ensure that all documentation is `mdoc` format. `s6` is a notable example of a
project that doesn't currently have manpages, though I believe that's something many people in the
community have been wanting.

There's a few tools written by the main `mandoc` dev that convert other formats to mdoc, they might
be worth looking at.

=== s6 based stuff

In Mutiny, a goal should be to have the same software powering many scopes of the system this
promotes the ability to have an intimate familiarity with the foundation of your system, and thus an
easier introduction to administrating it and doing cool stuff with it. A really good point in which
this can be carried out is in `s6` and `s6-rc`.

I have a work in progress implementation of doing this at the `xinit` level, since it's definitely
possible to do a supervisor as your session manager for Xorg sessions. Furthermore, this should be
able to be carried up to the login level. (call it `commune-session`, maybe) This could mean user
services for users on the system, perhaps akin to systemd's user scope...

=== Software contortions

* GNOME software

    ** https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettingsBackend.html#g-keyfile-settings-backend-new[gsettings' "keyfile" backend]
    *** `GSETTINGS_BACKEND=keyfile`
    *** https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettingsBackend.html#g-settings-backend-get-default["It is possible to override the default by setting the GSETTINGS_BACKEND environment variable to the name of a settings backend."]
* XDG contortions
