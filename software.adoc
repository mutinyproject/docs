== System
* https://adi.tilde.institute/pp/[pp] is a pretty cool pre-processor for files.

== Desktop
* https://github.com/TomaszGasior/gtk3-mushrooms[gtk3-mushrooms] - patches for gtk3 that make it
  nicer for non GNOME desktops. no CSD, client side shadows, and so on. though, maybe it'd be nicer
  to just avoid gtk3, if we can't do it without dbus...

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpid2[acpid] - not as extensive as i'd like; something like a
  real power manager type thing akin the power managers that come with MATE, GNOME, Xfce, and so on
  would be really nice
* https://github.com/troglobit/xplugd[xplugd]
* https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock[xss-lock]
* https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes[unclutter-xfixes]
* https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi[rofi]
* https://github.com/maandree/adjbacklight[adjbacklight]
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst] - a non-python alike would be nicer though...
* https://github.com/google/xsecurelock[xsecurelock]

== Misc
* https://www.passwordstore.org/[password-store] - something without a dependency on bash would be
  nicer though; there *are* some reimplementations/workalikes like https://github.com/nmeum/tpm[tpm]
  and https://notabug.org/kl3/spm[spm] are regular sh, but they lack a lot of features and
  niceities.
    ** https://github.com/dylanaraps/pash[pash] - appears to be more in line with what I want
* browser...?
