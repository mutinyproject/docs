:description: A list of software in line with the Mutiny philosophy.

== System
* https://sr.ht/~mcf/libtls-bearssl[libtls-bearssl] is an implementation of libtls using
  https://bearssl.org[BearSSL], one of the most promising SSL libraries in recent times.
* https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai[samurai] is an alternative implementation of `ninja`,
  which will be used instead of `ninja` in Mutiny.
* https://git.sr.ht/~mcf/cproc[cproc] is a C compiler using https://c9x.me/compile/[QBE] as the
  backend; it could be really compelling to base Mutiny around once it can build the kernel.
* https://mkws.sh/pp.html[pp] is a pretty cool pre-processor for files.

== Networking
* https://github.com/troglobit/mdnsd[mdnsd] - multicast daemon for announcing services
* https://github.com/ddevault/aerc[aerc] - terminal mail client that doesn't suck to setup anywhere
  near as much as mutt
* browser...?

== Desktop
* https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm] - tiling window manager using binary space
  partitioning, controlled via a socket-based command line program
* https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd] - Xorg hotkey daemon with a powerful configuration
  syntax, mouse chording, works very well with bspwm
* https://github.com/TomaszGasior/gtk3-mushrooms[gtk3-mushrooms] - patches for gtk3 that make it
  nicer for non GNOME desktops. no CSD, client side shadows, and so on. though, maybe it'd be nicer
  to just avoid gtk3, if we can't do it without dbus...
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpid2[acpid] - not as extensive as i'd like; something like a
  real power manager type thing akin the power managers that come with MATE, GNOME, Xfce, and so on
  would be really nice
* https://github.com/troglobit/xplugd[xplugd]
* https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock[xss-lock]
* https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes[unclutter-xfixes]
* https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi[rofi]
* https://github.com/maandree/adjbacklight[adjbacklight]
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst] - a non-python alike would be nicer though...
* https://github.com/google/xsecurelock[xsecurelock]

== Misc
* https://www.passwordstore.org/[password-store] - something without a dependency on bash would be
  nicer though; there *are* some reimplementations/workalikes like https://github.com/nmeum/tpm[tpm]
  and https://notabug.org/kl3/spm[spm] are regular sh, but they lack a lot of features and
  niceities.
    ** https://github.com/dylanaraps/pash[pash] - appears to be more in line with what I want
